# YAHDA
YAHDA is an acronym that stands for **Young Adult Health Data Analysis**. The datasets used in this project come from the [HCP - Young Adult data](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult) about the human brain.

## What is YAHDA?
The Human Connectome Project (HCP) provides the scientific community with data and discoveries that greatly enhance our understanding of human brain structure, function, and connectivity and their relationships to behavior.  


YAHDA is a data analysis project using raw data from HPC to show the effects of bedtime (sleep duration) on brain volume.
